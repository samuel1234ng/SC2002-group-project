Intellectual|Black Adam|4.0|its not as terrible as what critica said but it's still an enjoyable movie with flaws particularly the plot & dialogue with disposable villains. Still a great blockbuster
Renier|Black Adam|5.0|Must watch. A very good movie!!!
Ben|Smile|3.0|So - so horror movie
Lala|Smile|5.0|A good watch! Decent amounts of suspense and scares with a good ending (or is it!? lol). Give this a try, you won't regret it!😎
Wil|Smile|4.0|worth to watch
Ahmad|Black Adam|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie! Dwayne Johnson is the perfect Black Adam, and the other cast members did pretty well! Looking forward to more DC movies!
Naufal|Black Adam|5.0|Amazing movie. First time I've seen a DC franchise without batting an eye! Fantastic graphics! Even if you don't know who Black Adam is before this, you'd definitely remember him after the movie! 10/10. Wouldn't change a thing about it! DC FTW! (^_^)
Azrael|Black Adam|2.0|only for those who like action and nothing else in their movies. brosnan is trying very hard to save it here, and every part of the story feels like something we've seen before. but ofc you'll get a ticket and stay for the post-credit scene, duh.
Shun Andreas|Smile|5.0|You won't be smiling after the movie, because you will be horrified and terrified by the horror elements and super eerily composed Soundtracks. One of the best horror movie from the past three years.
yumeng|Smile|5.0|good
Moon|Ticket To Paradise|4.0|Happy and refreshing story
Samuel|Ticket To Paradise|4.0|Good movie but same kind of plot. It is all about the chemistry between Clooney and Roberts
Karen|Ticket To Paradise|5.0|Excellent on screen chemistry between George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Add to that the beautiful scenary, this romantic comedy is a must watch.
Eileen|Ticket to Paradise|5.0|Hilarious! 😂Good movie to destress and worth watching👍
raisa|Ticket to Paradise|3.0|decent watch
Ryla Zahiera|Thank God|5.0|love the plot! such a refreshing movie 😊
Karanjit|Thank God|5.0|very good lesson on life
Eileen|Come Back Home 搜救|4.0|Intense but sad ending
Pei Yu|Come Back Home 搜救|5.0|Not your typical Donnie Yen action film, but a touching family, father-son tale! Remember to bring some tissue!
Tiger|Come Back Home 搜救|5.0|Very touching movie! 😭😭 Pace is very deliberate and you have to get into the character's shoes to understand some decisions / actions taken! The backdrop and scenes also very grand, beautiful. 5 stars!
Soo Fang|Ajoomma|5.0|very touching story. HuiFang's acting truly reflects a mother's feeling
Chin|Ajoomma|5.0|Bravo!!! Huifang is truly natural at acting, not excessively over-acting. 😃 I understand why she's most favourably chosen to act as e ordinary auntie, instead of all other excellent actresses. 😉 Thank you, Hong Huifang! 🙏
Stephanie|Ajoomma|4.0|The storyline could be more in-dept but overall warm hearted
PK|Ajoomma|4.0|Warm movie to watch. The journey of a Singaporean auntie to find herself. The subplot of her son seems a bit contrived. Would recommend to watch and support this show!
Chery|Ajoomma|4.0|Very touching movie and excellent actors and actresses. Kudos to all involved in this movie production
Chern Choong|Black Adam|5.0|Entertaining. Non-stop action from start to end.
Shikhar Jain|Smile|4.0|average movie
